## What this project does?

This project gets JSON data from a [covid 19 api](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc#00030720-fae3-4c72-8aea-ad01ba17adf8). Converts it to a dataframe with the help of the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) libraries.

The dataframe is used used to make basic graphs with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

In time, the dataframe is going to be used as a dataset for a neural network written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Why did you build this project?
    
    WE bulded this projects to learn more about how to use the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) oython technology. 
    It does not really as an application, it was just to learn and really for fun.
